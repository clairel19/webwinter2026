    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">There are several types of Sea Turtle Species: Green, Leatherback, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Kemp's Ridley, and Flatback. Most of them are named from their shell of back.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 18px;">This is just a quick photo the 7 different types of sea turtles.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">They have hard or leathery shells that protect them. Their flippers are adpated for swimming long distances. But unlike land turtles, they cannot pull their head back into their shells to protect them from preditors.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;color:lightseagreen;"> Where Sea turtles are found.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">They are found in tropical or subtropical oceans around the world like the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Mediterranean. They like to avoid cold frigid waters. Different species prefer different environments.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;color:lightseagreen;"> Sea Turtles Diet</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Sea turtles diets vary by species. The Green species mostly eat sea grass and algae. The Loggerheads mainly eat crabs and shellfish. And the Leatherbacks mainly eat large soft-bodied jellyfish like moon jellyfish, sea nettles, Lion's main jellyfish, barrel fish.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;color:lightseagreen;">Sea Turtles Life Cycle</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Sea turtles have a long life cycle and not many of them make it. First, the female sea turtles return to beaches to lay their eggs. Once the eggs hatch, the baby sea turtles move towards the ocean instictively. When they are hatchlings, that is the most dangerous phase. About 1 in 1,000 make it to adulthood. Than the young sea turtles drift in the ocean learning to eat and provide for themselves and family. Then when they are more grown up, they more to coastal feeding areas. This stage can last a long time. Sea turtles reach maturnity at around 20-30 years (sometimes longer) and the adults migrate around between feeding and nesting grounds. Then the female turtles go back to the beach to lay eggs.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;color:lightseagreen;">Sea Turtles Endangered</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Sea turtles have been considered an endagered species for many decades. The 1970s is when they were finally recognized that they were an endangered species by Florida. In 1978 the U.S., green sea turtles were listed as a threatened animal species. By 1981, they were not allowed to be trading sea turtles and if people did, that would be illegal. They became endangered because they were hunted for their shells, meat, eggs, and leather. They also went through habitat lost and they were being entangled in fishing gear like fish nets. Climate change to also changed their species affecting their nesting sites. But, in late 2025, Green turtles were no longer considered an endangered species and were removed off the endangered list and now are on the "Least Concern" list. Although there are still many threats to them.</p>
