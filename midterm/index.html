         <p style="color:lightseagreen; font-size: 18px;">Sea turtles are ancient, air-breathing marine reptiles with streamlined bodies, large flippers, and hard shells (except leatherbacks) that live in tropical and subtropical oceans, migrating vast distances but returning to land for females to lay eggs in the sand. They have existed for over 100 million years.</p>

       <p style="font-size: 18px;">There are many types of sea turtles. But most species of sea turtles are endangered because of the trash in the ocean. They spend almost all of their time in the water but they come up for to the surface to breathe air.</p>
